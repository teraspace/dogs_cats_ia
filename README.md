# neuron, vector, unvector and unvector_derivative.

All them are excersies where successfully I learnt the core theory about Machine Learning, Perceptron and Deep Learning with AndrewNg courses.

The most interesting was unvector and unvector_derivative because I write code for calculates derivatives by hand.


# Main Excercise dogs_cats_ia
Dogs and cats classfier by using pure neuros IA

For test purpose you can run the neura_network_class_image.ipynb with jupyter.

neural_network.py its a class 100% written for me applying knowledgments adquired on Coursera Andrew Ng's course.



Here link to codelabs https://colab.research.google.com/github/teraspace/dogs_cats_ia/blob/master/neura_network_class_image.ipynb

Maybe you'll need download collections cat, dog and tests from this repository to Colab by login with your own account.



You can use them but please respecting my "by Carlos Manuel Pati√±o".

Enjoy!!!
